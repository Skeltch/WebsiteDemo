	<h1>My Story</h1>
	<p style="padding: 10px 100px;">
		I am a fan of many things and currently my hobby aligns with Formula 1 as you could probably tell. I am a modern car enthusiast
		and love the engineering and design that goes into todays super cars. This led me into the Formula 1 scene. 
		My passion in Computer Science came in senior year of highschool where I was introduced to Java. 
		Before this I was in love with physics and calculus and decided to major in Electrical and Computer Engineering,
		hoping there would be a combination of the three. As I delved into the world of computer science I decided that
		I would like to pursue a career in this field specifically. Electrical engineering still is an interest as one of my
		favorite classes was Computer Architecture where we learned how to build a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit all the way from
		transistors to the actual unit. The low level hardware and software are incredibly complex and interesting, however currently
		I just stick to coding.

	<h1>Background</h1>
	<p style="padding: 10px 100px;">
		I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer studying at Rutgers University and currently a KTech Engineering intern at KPMG.
		My first and best language is Java, however my college taught mostly C++. I used C++ for the Institute of 
		Electrical and Electronics Engineers along with OpenCV, VEX Robotics, and Arduinos.	I learned PHP and MySQL for a 
		software engineering project called TutorU made in Android Studios.
		I self learned Python to help in my research, and HTML and CSS for my internship. 
		I used MATLAB for a small research opportunity and learned an interesting language for circuit design called 
		SystemVerilog. This is probably the most unique language I know.

	<h1>Experiences</h1>
	<p style="padding: 10px 100px;">
		My past experiences include a Research Assistant, Research Volunteer, and Culture Chair for
		Rutgers Chinese Student Organization. I have developed some small projects with my friends and led
		my Software Engineering team to create an Android app called TutorU. I built the backend in Digital Ocean
		using PHP and MySQL as a demo, the UI and networking interface as well. In the summer of my freshman year
		I joined as a research assistant, studying insect flight patterns using MATLAB. In my sophomore year I
		joined the Rutgers Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers to create a robot using computer vision.
		We would go on to compete in hackathons like HackRU. Continuing in this area, I joined the 
		Rutgers Aresty Research program as a Research Assistant to help develop	a neural network. 
		This network would use OpenCV to track a face and train the model to find correlations between
		an audio sequence of someone talking and the movements of a face. I was featured in 
		<a href="http://news.rutgers.edu/news/aresty-symposium-showcase-research-rutgers-undergraduates/20170423">Rutgers today</a>
		,accepted to the <a href="http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com/">2017 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</a>, specifically the 
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dalcom2017cvpr/programme">1st International Workshop on Deep Affective Learning and Context Modelling (DAL-COM)</a> 
		in Honolulu, Hawaii under Hai Xua Pham and Vladimir Pavlovic,
		and my paper is viewable <a href="http://research.cs.rutgers.edu/~hxp1/rc_images/hai_spchdrivenfaceanimation_cvprw2017.pdf">here.</a>
