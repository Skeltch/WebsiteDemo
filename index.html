	<p style="padding: 10px 100px;">I am a fan of many things and currently my hobby aligns with Formula 1 as you could probably tell.
		In the past I have enjoyed Astrophysics, Astronomy, and Theoretical Physics as simply interests. I am a modern car enthusiast
		and love the engineering and design that goes into todays super cars. This led me into the Formula 1 scene.
		I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer studying at Rutgers University and an intern at KPMG.
		My past experiences include a Research Assistant, Research Volunteer, and Culture Chair for
		Rutgers Chinese Student Organization. I have developed some small projects with my friends and led
		my Software Engineering team to create an Android app called TutorU. My passion in Computer Science
		came in senior year of highschool where I was introduced to Java. Before this I was in love with 
		physics and calculus and decided to major in Electrical and Computer Engineering, hoping there would
		be a combination of the three. As I delved into the world of computer science I decided that
		I would like to pursue a career in this field specifically. As such in the summer of my freshman year
		I joined as a research assistant, studying insect flight patterns using MATLAB. In my sophomore year I
		joined the Rutgers Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers to create a robot using computer vision.
		Continuing in this area, I joined the Rutgers Aresty Research program as a Research Assistant to help develop
		a neural network. This network would use OpenCV to track a face and train the model to find correlations between
		an audio sequence of someone talking and the movements of a face. I was featured in 
		<a href="http://news.rutgers.edu/news/aresty-symposium-showcase-research-rutgers-undergraduates/20170423">Rutgers today</a>
		,accepted to the <a href="http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com/">2017 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</a>, specifically the 
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dalcom2017cvpr/programme">1st International Workshop on Deep Affective Learning and Context Modelling (DAL-COM)</a> 
		in Honolulu, Hawaii under Hai Xua Pham and Vladimir Pavlovic,
		and my paper is viewable <a href="http://research.cs.rutgers.edu/~hxp1/rc_images/hai_spchdrivenfaceanimation_cvprw2017.pdf">here.</a>
