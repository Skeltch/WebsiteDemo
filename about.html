	<h1>Formula 1</h1>
		<p>
			There were too many good photos to use for Formula 1 so most of these pages will be of Formula 1.
			My favorite team would be Red Bull Racing with Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen. The engineering,
			strategy, and endurance required in Formula 1 is astounding. With new limitations set every year
			the engineers of each team find incredible ways to compete. <!--History of F1?--> Today's V6 Engines
			are arguably not as loud and powerful sounding, however the hybrid drive train is incredibly powerful
			and adds a new complexity and strategy. This along with the Drag Reduction System allow for 
			<a href="https://youtu.be/HKgPjUcvPcc?t=3">incredible plays</a>.
			The amount of stress put on the cars, tires, and drivers
			create an incredible environment of innovation. This page is dedicated to Lewis Hamilton and 
			Nico Rosberg from Mercedes AMG Petronas because these were some great pictures. Most pictures were obtained from this 
			<a href="http://imgur.com/a/28e42">album</a>. Aside from F1, my favorite car would be the McLaren P1, 
			or the Corvette Z06 due to their power and incredible looks.

	<h1>Hobbies</h1>
		<p>
			Ontop of Formula 1 and cars I enjoy playing a large variety of games. I enjoy games from Factorio to Rocket League 
			and many more. I have also played the French Horn and Clarinet in the past. I love pets as well, adopting a stray 
			cat from my neighborhood and saving a kitten whos mother died from the sewer. I frequently go to the gym and 
			would like to start getting into fixing upgrading cars.
			I'm not the most informed about cars and Formula 1 but I'm always willing to talk or learn more about anything. You can reach me 
			<a href="Contact.html">here</a>.
